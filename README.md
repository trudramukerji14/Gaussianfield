# Gaussianfield


This repository contains a rough Pytorch implementation of a model introduced in the well-cited work:
["Semi-Supervised Learning Using Gaussian Fields and Harmonic Functions"](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/zgl.pdf)


 This work was written in colab and is a work in progress.
